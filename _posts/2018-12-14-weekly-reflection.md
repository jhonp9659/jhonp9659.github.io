# REFLECTION ON MY PROCESS
During the last 2 weeks of class working on my flag has been difficult. Although i do understand the size of my flag it's been really hard trying to change the flag by only changing one value. I've been working on my flag consistently and i when i was done programing my flag i realized that 1 thing that was going to be my biggest problem is rotating the star i do not know how to rotate a shape and next week i will be asking for help in com√πter science besides the star everything else has been a piece of cake with the help of the function put image. I used 2 rectangles to make the base and the white bar that takes up 1/4 of the flag i also used 2 circles to make a crescent because the moon like crescent is not a simple shape i used the colors dark green and white. all that's left for this section of the project is for me to rotate that star and that's one thing i look forward to learning about next week in computer science.
