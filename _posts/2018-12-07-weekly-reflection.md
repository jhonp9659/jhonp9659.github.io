# Pakistan 

The flag that i did is pakistan i learned alot about this flag for example how the borders have to be 2:3 or 2 inches for width and 3 inches for the height. The flag contains different types of shapes which most of them are basic ``` rectangle, circle ,star etc.```. The pakistan flag is made up of rectangles and a star and a moon shaped crescent,the crescent was s little difficult to make because it is not a simple shape so what i did was that i took a simple shape like ``` circle ``` and doubled it both a green one and a white one i placed the green one on top of the white 0ne to make the white one look like a moon since the base color is dark green. Once i was done with the star and the crescent i started to cut out a rectangle that had to be ¼ of the widths size which ¼ of 3 is ¾ and i glued everything together and it looked really good at the end.:computer: 

# Question 
this week during our flag project 1 question i had was “so if i do choice 1 can i also get a professional?”. I asked this question because i was unsure of the grade i would get if i do choice one which was a practitioner level flag. Then mr allata told me that the highest level i can get if i do choice 1 is practitioner and if i do choice 2 the highest level i can get is a professional
