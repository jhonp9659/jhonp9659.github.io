I chose question 5, question 5 says "what is the value of the following question?" ```(+(/56(* 2 4)) (-3 -7))```.I chose this question because i was confused at first but then caught on. So to get the answer you must start by realizing that each parenthesis stands for its own equation. I started by subtracting ```(-3 -7)``` because it has the function (-) which means subtraction my solution is -4. Once im done with that i moved on to the next step which is ```(* 2 4)``` the function stands for multiplication so i multiplied and got 8, within that set of parentheses it says /56 so i divided 56 by 8 and i got 7. When i have my 2 solutions -10 and 7 i saw that there was one more function ```(+)``` so i changed the sign of the 10n to positive 10 and added i got the value ```17``` as the answer which is the correct answer choice.Although i broke it down most people chose a which is the incorrect answer i do not know what they did to get this answer but i guess that they mixed their values around and got the wrong solution.
