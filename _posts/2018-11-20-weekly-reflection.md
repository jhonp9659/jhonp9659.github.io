![my game image ](/images/download.png)
MY game is going to be based on my favorite anime (naruto).In one of my favorite episodes the main character naruto uzumaki goes face to face with one of his classmates (gaara) whith the red hair which he is lost in the darkness. Naruto feels like is his respponsibility to get him back. My game is going to be recreating thier battle which naruto is the player and gaara is the danger or the bad guy and since narutos favorite food is ramen i made it so that it could be the price,i chose the background to be konoha the hidden leaf village which is where naruto lives. Some things that i had trouble with is finding the background and changing the size of it so that it could all fit.overall my game is going as planned and i hope it works at the end.
